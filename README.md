Dear Selection Commitee,

This is my submission of the Hangtime Coding Challenge.
This directory contains my solution the script ht_events.py,
the output of my script when redirected to the file
HangtimeReport_David_Qu.txt, and a copy of my resume.

Thank you for the opportunity to apply for a position at
Hangtime, and participate in this exciting challenge!
I look forward to hearing from you about how I can be a part 
of the team.

Best regards,

Original README:

Hangtime Coding Challenge
=========================
This is a very open-ended problem so you can run with it and have fun. Our goal is to see your code, coding style, problem solving and creative/critical thinking skills. Spend as much or as little time on the challenge as you'd like.

events.json contains data for a set of events from Hangtime.

The goal here is to pull out some interesting data about these events. The program can be written in any language. It should output its result in a human-readable format. The program should make extensive use of code commenting to explain whatever methods you're using.

To submit your program, send an archive containing a brief README, program files, data files (if any), and your resume to jobs at hangtime.com.

It's not necessary to use any extra data. But, should you like to, complete data for any event is available at http://api.hangtime.com/mobile/events/[event_id].json.
